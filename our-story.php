        <p>We’ve known each other for about 8 years. In that time we’ve been together and we’ve been apart. Early on I left for school and we both graduated and started our careers.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, we reconnected at just the right time. Having fallen for each other a second time, I moved back to Virginia and after dating for a few years, we moved into our first apartment together. Three years ago, on New Year’s Eve, I proposed to Christine after watching our favorite Pixar movie, “Up”.</p>
        <p>In all this time we’ve grown up quite a bit. We’ve lost jobs and very dear family members. Though they can’t be here, we’re excited to finally be married and start living the rest of our lives together.</p>
